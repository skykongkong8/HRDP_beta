  By not providing "Findhrdp_beta_actions.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "hrdp_beta_actions", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "hrdp_beta_actions"
  with any of the following names:

    hrdp_beta_actionsConfig.cmake
    hrdp_beta_actions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "hrdp_beta_actions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "hrdp_beta_actions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "hrdp_beta_actions" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
